Implements a recursive maze solver in Java using backtracking on a 2D grid. Includes methods for path existence (findMazePath), enumerating all paths (findAllMazePaths), and finding the shortest path (findMazePathMin). Features a Swing-based GUI (MazeTest) for building, visualizing, and testing maze solutions interactively.
